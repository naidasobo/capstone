Hello, my name is Naida Sobo and this is my useful To do list App, 
which I have created in order to be able to
document my exciting hobby of modifying classic cars.

This To Do List App enables me to keep track of upcoming 
and completed creative projects on my 1986 Chevy El Camino.

The To Do List app works by typing in To Do items, which are then displayed in list form.

Each time a task is complete, we can cross it off the list by clicking on it once.

The app also makes it possible to remove projects and create space for
new ones, by simply double clicking the item we wish to remove.
